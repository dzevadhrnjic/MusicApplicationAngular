# MusicApplicationFrontend

This is angular application that is used for my backend musicApplication.

I have created following angular components:

- create-song: from this component we call post api to create new song based on user input values
- edit-song: from this component we call put api to edit song based on user input values
- song-deatils: from this component we show song details
- song-list: from this component we show all songs

To run the application run following commands:
-npm install - to install all required dependecies
-npm start - to start application on localhost:4200
